# time-series-demand-Prediction
This project is based on how to predict multivariate time series data. Build.
a bidirectional LSTM neural network in Keras and TensorFlow 2 and use it to make predictions.
# The Data
Our Data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset.
The dataset contains historical demand data along with other relevant features such as date, product ID, and weather conditions. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
# Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess its performance in predicting demand. Cross-validation techniques may also be used to validate the model's generalization ability.
# Results
The results of the demand prediction model are presented in terms of accuracy metrics and visualizations comparing predicted demand with actual demand. Insights may be drawn from the results to improve inventory management and business decision-making.
